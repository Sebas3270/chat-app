# Chat App

A new Flutter app to improve my current sockets knowledge, this app allows you send and receive messages from other users, to see when they're online and offline, store tokens and use them to make requests and many other things, this app uses this [backend](https://github.com/Sebas3270/chat-app-backend) to work, you can check it to see the sockets implementation.
